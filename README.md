# weather-dashboard
Weather Dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS

## The Brief

Use the Open Weather Map API to display the current, and 5 day forecast for a city.

## Basic features include:

```
    * On opening the page the geolocation function is utilised to dispaly the weather for the user's current location
    * A search bar also appears on the LHS whereby the user can search for a city
    * Once the page loads it will display the following information
        - Current Day: Date, Icon, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed and a UV index that is colour coded
        - Five Day: Date, Temperature, Humidity. Icon
    * The City Name, Latitude and Longitude are saved into a button on the page, so if the user decides to search for that city again it skips the initial API call 
        and  moves directly into the get weather function    
    * If there is saved details in the local storage from a previous use, these will populate once the page loads as buttons

```
